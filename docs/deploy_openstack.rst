OpenStack Deployment
====================

.. note:: Althouth we would like to support different `OpenStack <https://www.openstack.org/>`__ environments, we
          tested :ref:`openstack_deploy` just for the `ISP RAS one <http://www.bigdataopenlab.ru/about.html>`__.

Additional Software Requirements
--------------------------------

To install additional packages required only by OpenStack deployment scripts you need to execute the following command::

    $ pip install .[openstack]

.. note:: If in the previous step you installed Klever package with the `-e` argument, then you should use it here as
          well (i.e. execute `pip install -e .[openstack]`).

Supported Options
-----------------

:ref:`openstack_deploy` supports 3 kinds of entities:

* :ref:`klever_base_image` - with default settings this is a Debian 9 OpenStack image with installed Klever
  dependencies.
  Using :ref:`klever_base_image` allows to substantially reduce a time for deploying other entities.
* :ref:`klever_dev_inst` - an OpenStack instance for development purposes.
  For :ref:`klever_dev_inst` many debug options are activated by default.
* :ref:`klever_experiment_inst` - a specified number of OpenStack instances for performing various experiments.

In addition to command-line arguments mentioned below, there are several optional command-line arguments which you can
find out by running:

.. parsed-literal::

   $ klever-deploy-openstack --help

.. _klever_base_image:

Klever Base Image
-----------------

For :ref:`klever_base_image` you can execute actions *show*, *create* and *remove*.
The common workflow for :ref:`klever_base_image` is :menuselection:`create --> remove`, e.g.:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ klever-deploy-openstack --ssh-rsa-private-key-file :term:`$SSH_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` create "Klever base image"

Unless specified, name *Klever Base* is used for new :ref:`klever_base_image`.
If there is already an image with such the name it will be renamed automatically by adding suffix *deprecated* (indeed,
this is done recursively with using ordinal numbers of images in addition, so, no images will be lost and there will be
no duplicates).

.. _klever_dev_inst:

Klever Developer Instance
-------------------------

For :ref:`klever_dev_inst` you can execute actions *show*, *create*, *update*, *ssh*, *remove*, *share* and *hide*.
Basically you should perform actions with :ref:`klever_dev_inst` in the following order
:menuselection:`create --> update --> update --> ... --> update --> remove` exactly as for :ref:`local_deploy`, e.g.:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ klever-deploy-openstack --ssh-rsa-private-key-file :term:`$SSH_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` create "Klever developer instance"

In addition, between creating and removing you can also *share*/*hide* for/from the outside world :ref:`klever_dev_inst`
and open an SSH connection to it.
By default a name for :ref:`klever_dev_inst` is a concatenation of an OpenStack username and *-klever-dev*.

.. _klever_experiment_inst:

Klever Experimental Instances
-----------------------------

For :ref:`klever_experiment_inst` you can execute actions *show*, *create*, *update* and *remove*.
The normal workflow for :ref:`klever_experiment_inst` is the same as for :ref:`klever_dev_inst`, e.g.:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ klever-deploy-openstack --ssh-rsa-private-key-file :term:`$SSH_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` --instances :term:`$INSTANCES` create "Klever experimental instances"
